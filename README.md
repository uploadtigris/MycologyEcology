## Overview
Welcome to **The Mycology Ecology Project**, a data visualization and analysis initiative focused on exploring the relationship between fungal biodiversity and environmental factors, with an emphasis on the impact of climate change. This project combines ecological research, open-source data, and advanced visualization techniques to uncover insights into the fascinating world of fungi and their role in global ecosystems.

Fungi are one of the most biodiverse kingdoms on Earth, playing critical roles in nutrient cycling, ecosystem functioning, and even industrial applications. However, environmental changes, such as elevated CO‚ÇÇ levels and global warming, threaten fungal biodiversity. This project aims to investigate these challenges through data-driven analysis and storytelling.

## Objectives
1. **Investigate the Relationship Between CO‚ÇÇ Levels and Fungal Biodiversity**  
   - Analyze how elevated atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ impacts fungal species richness, evenness, and community composition.
   - Focus on direct effects of CO‚ÇÇ on fungal physiology and indirect effects via host plants.

2. **Visualize Fungal Diversity Across Environmental Gradients**  
   - Use datasets like the GlobalFungi database to map fungal diversity across ecosystems.
   - Explore correlations between fungal diversity and environmental factors such as soil pH, organic matter content, and temperature.

3. **Raise Awareness About Fungal Biodiversity Conservation**  
   - Highlight the importance of fungi in maintaining ecosystem health and their potential applications in industries like food production and biotechnology.

---

## Hypotheses
- Elevated atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ reduces fungal biodiversity by altering physiological processes and community composition.
- Fungal diversity is positively correlated with specific environmental factors such as soil pH, organic matter content, and temperature.
- Climate change indicators (e.g., rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns) are shifting fungal growth rates over time.

---

## Datasets
We leverage several open-source datasets for this project:
- **GlobalFungi Database**: Comprehensive data on fungal species worldwide (5,301 genera; 20,525 species).
- **U.S. National Fungus Collections**: Data on pathogenic fungi and their host plants.
- **iNaturalist ‚ÄòResearch Grade‚Äô Data**: Citizen science observations of fungi.
- **Texas Parks & Wildlife GIS Data**: Regional data on Texas mycology for localized analysis.
- **Climate Datasets**: Atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ levels and climate indicators from publicly available sources.

---

## Visualizations
We aim to create compelling visualizations that make complex ecological data accessible:
- **Heatmaps**: Fungal diversity across geographic regions.
- **Scatterplots**: Correlations between fungal diversity metrics (e.g., richness) and environmental factors like CO‚ÇÇ levels or soil pH.
- **Time-Series Plots**: Trends in fungal growth rates under different climate scenarios.
- **Network Diagrams**: Symbiotic relationships in arid ecosystems (e.g., nutrient cycling between fungi, soil crusts, and plants).
- **Decision Trees & Violin Plots**: Comparing physical characteristics of edible vs. poisonous mushrooms.

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review (Week 1)**  
   - Review key papers on CO‚ÇÇ effects on fungal biodiversity using Zotero for citation management.
   
2. **Data Selection (Week 2)**  
   - Extract relevant subsets from the GlobalFungi database focusing on specific ecosystems or regions (e.g., Texas grasslands).

3. **Data Analysis (Weeks 3‚Äì4)**  
   - Use Python or R for statistical analysis:
     - Correlate fungal diversity metrics with CO‚ÇÇ levels.
     - Identify trends in species richness or community composition.

4. **Visualization & Reporting (Weeks 5‚Äì6)**  
   - Create scatterplots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc., to communicate findings effectively.
   - Compile a concise report summarizing methods, results, and implications.

## Deliverables
1. **Visualizations**
   - Scatterplots showing relationships between CO‚ÇÇ levels and fungal diversity metrics.
   - Heatmaps of fungal diversity across regions or ecosystems.
   - Time-series plots illustrating growth rate trends under climate change scenarios.

2. **Report**
   - A ~5-page summary including:
     - Introduction: Importance of fungi and challenges posed by rising CO‚ÇÇ levels.
     - Methods: Data sources and analytical techniques.
     - Results: Key findings with visualizations.
     - Discussion: Implications for biodiversity conservation under climate change.
     - Conclusion: Recommendations for future research.

## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies
### Time Constraints
- Focus on one ecosystem type or region to reduce complexity (e.g., Texas grasslands).  
- Skip lab experiments if time is insufficient; rely on existing datasets.

### Data Quality
- Use well-documented entries from the GlobalFungi database to ensure reliability.  
- Validate findings by cross-referencing multiple datasets.

### Confounding Variables
- Acknowledge limitations in attributing biodiversity changes solely to CO‚ÇÇ levels.  
- Discuss potential influences of other environmental factors like temperature or precipitation.

## The Story We Want to Tell üåçüçÑ
### The Case for Fungi  
Fungi are essential for ecosystem health and industrial innovation. Conserving their biodiversity ensures a natural environment where new species can thrive‚Äîbenefiting both nature and humanity.

### The Problem  
Climate change poses significant threats to fungal biodiversity through:
1. Direct effects of elevated CO‚ÇÇ on fungal physiology.
2. Indirect effects via host plants altering resource availability.
3. Community-level effects reducing diversity due to competition among species.

By understanding these dynamics through data-driven analysis, we can better advocate for conservation efforts that protect this vital kingdom.
